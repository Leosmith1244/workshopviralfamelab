# PR Pros Toastmasters: Viral Fame Lab Workshop Website ðŸš€

## Project Overview
Welcome to the official website for the **Viral Fame Lab: Crack the Code of Explosive Content** workshop, hosted by PR Pros Toastmasters. This dynamic workshop, scheduled for 2025, empowers PR professionals and Toastmasters members to create compelling, viral content using **Aristotleâ€™s Rhetorical Triangle** (Ethos, Pathos, Logos). The site serves as a central hub for workshop information, including a detailed agenda, speaker guides, and an in-depth exploration of the Rhetorical Triangle, all designed to inspire and educate attendees.

This repository contains all files for the workshopâ€™s static website, built with Toastmasters branding for a professional, visually appealing experience and optimized for seamless deployment.

- **Rhetorical Triangle Deep Dive**: An in-depth explanation of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos, with real-world and Toastmasters-specific PR examples.
- **Interactive Registration Form**: A Netlify Forms-ready form on the home page for attendee sign-ups, with client-side validation.
- **Toastmasters Branding**: Incorporates official Toastmasters colors (navy blue, gold) and typography for a cohesive, professional look.
